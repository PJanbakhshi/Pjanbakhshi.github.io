My current research:

Automatic pathological speech assessment can provide reliable and cost-effective computer-aided tools to assist the clinical diagnosis and management of speech disorders. Such automatic analyses include speech intelligibility assessments, pathology detection, i.e.,  discriminating between normal and pathological speech, and classification of different speech pathologies.
For my PhD research, I am working on developing reliable and novel machine learning and signal processing techniques for analysing continous speech for clinical applications applicable to different pathological conditions and languages.
 


My previous research:
During my Master's studies, I worked on biological signal processing with my thesis especially focused on the extraction of respiratory information from ECG signals and investigating its application for sleep apnea detection.
