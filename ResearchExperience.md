My current research:

<p align="justify">
Automatic pathological speech assessment can provide reliable and cost-effective computer-aided tools to assist the clinical diagnosis and management of speech disorders. Such automatic analyses include speech intelligibility assessments, pathology detection, i.e.,  discriminating between normal and pathological speech, and classification of different speech pathologies.
For my Ph.D. research, I am working on developing reliable and novel machine learning and signal processing techniques for analysing continuous speech for clinical applications applicable to different pathological conditions and languages.

My previous research:

<p align="justify">
During my Master's studies, I worked on biological signal processing with my Master's thesis especially being focused on the extraction of respiratory information from ECG signals and investigating its application for sleep apnea detection. I worked on Gaussian Process modeling and phase space reconstruction methods to extract respiration estimation from single-lead ECG, and also I developed a sleep apnea detection system based on ECG information. During a research internship on a neuroscience project, I also worked on investigating the phase-amplitude coupling in the extracellular neural activity recordings.
