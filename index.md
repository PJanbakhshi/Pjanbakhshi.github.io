I am a research assistant in the [Speech group at Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/speech-and-audio-processing), Martigny, and I am also a PhD candidateÂ affiliated at the Electrical Engineering doctoral program of EPFL, Switzerland.

Currently, I am working on automcatic speech analysis for medical applications, i.e., pathological speech intelligibility assessment, speech pathology assessment and detection, and the purpose is to develop novel and reliable signal processing and machine learning approaches generalizable to different pathological conditions and languages. My PhD research is funded by the interdisciplinary [MoSpeeDi](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/mospeedi/) project on studying motor speech disorders.
