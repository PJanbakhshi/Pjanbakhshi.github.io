I am a research assistant in the <[Speech group at Idiap Research Institute]>(https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/speech-and-audio-processing), Martigny, and I am also a PhD candidateÂ affiliated at the Electrical Engineering doctoral program of EPFL, Switzerland.

Currently, I am working on automcatic speech analysis for medical applications, i.e., pathological speech intelligibility assessment, speech pathology assessment and detection. My PhD research is funded by the interdisciplinary [MoSpeeDi](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/mospeedi/) project on studying motor speech disorders.
