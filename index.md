I am a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/speech-and-audio-processing">Speech group at Idiap Research Institute</a>, Martigny, and I am also a PhD candidateÂ affiliated at the Electrical Engineering doctoral program of EPFL, Switzerland.


Currently, I am working on automcatic speech analysis for medical applications, i.e., pathological speech intelligibility assessment, speech pathology assessment and detection. My PhD research is funded by the interdisciplinary <a href="https://www.unige.ch/fapse/mospeedi/">MoSpeeDi</a> project on studying motor speech disorders.
