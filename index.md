I am a research assistant in the Speech group at Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, and I am also a PhD candidateÂ affiliated at the Electrical Engineering doctoral program of EPFL, Switzerland.

My PhD research is funded by the interdisciplinary [MoSpeeDi](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/mospeedi/) project, which aims to study motor speech disorders by automatic speech analyses such as objective pathological intelligibility assessment, speech pathology detection, and classification. More precisely, the purpose is to develop novel and reliable signal processing and machine learning approaches generalizable to different pathological conditions and languages



- I rock a great mustache
